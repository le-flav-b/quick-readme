## Supported OSS/CDN Comparison

| OSS/CDN | Advantage | Disadvantage |
|-- |-- | -- |
| [qiniu](https://www.qiniu.com/prices) | totally 10G free storage; monthly 1 million times free viewing; fast net access globally; big and stable company in China | need filing domain approved by China goverment for accessibility ðŸ˜‚ |
| github | based on github, little limitation if you follow the [terms of service](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/) and [github pages limits](https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-github-pages/#usage-limits); great and stable company | access is slow in China |
| [cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/pricing) | totally 10G free storage for at most 300K items, 20 GB free monthly net viewing bandwith, fast net access globally | a small and unstable company? (not sure) |
| [sm.ms](https://sm.ms/) | No limitation, fast access in China | no account, and you can not manage your picture, private projects |
| [s3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) | no minimum fee, fast access in global | not free |

> This extension is made originally for writing my personal [techblog](https://www.njleonzhang.com/), which means the storage and network access cost to the CDN should be small. You should not use this extension to upload pitures with mass access to `github`, which may exceed [github pages limits](https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-github-pages/#usage-limits).

## PR welcomed
* support more OSS/CDN, such as Azure storage, refer to [current code](https://github.com/njleonzhang/vscode-extension-mardown-image-paste/blob/master/src/CdnUploader/)

## Development
Clone the porject, and open it in vscode. press `F5` to start debug mode after `npm install the dependency`. At last, run `npm run package` to package a extension `vsix` file, and install it to your vscode for test.

## Limitations
1. need to install a extra node module, [electron-image-ipc-server](https://github.com/njleonzhang/electron-image-ipc-server). if we bundle the electron in the extension, the extension size will be more than 70M. `electron-image-ipc-server` is started as a long live electron process by the extension.
2. can not support `gif` due to the [limitation of electron api](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/8485)
